Subject: Request to Enable PHP OPcache for Performance Optimization

Dear Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with enabling PHP OPcache on my server account (username: aboksdfs, domain: app.pointwave.ng).

ISSUE:
Our Laravel application is experiencing significant performance issues with slow page load times (10-30 seconds) and pages occasionally going blank, requiring multiple refreshes. After running diagnostics, we identified that PHP OPcache is currently disabled on our server.

IMPACT:
Without OPcache, PHP must recompile our application code on every single request, which causes a 5-10x performance degradation. This is severely impacting our users' experience and our business operations.

REQUEST:
Could you please enable PHP OPcache for our account with the following recommended settings:

opcache.enable=1
opcache.memory_consumption=256
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=16
opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
opcache.revalidate_freq=2
opcache.fast_shutdown=1
opcache.enable_cli=0

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Server: server350
- Account: aboksdfs
- Domain: app.pointwave.ng
- Application: Laravel PHP Framework
- Current PHP Version: [Your PHP version]
- Current OPcache Status: Disabled

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Enabling OPcache will reduce our page load times from 10-30 seconds to 1-3 seconds, providing a significantly better user experience and reducing server load.

If there are any concerns or alternative solutions you'd recommend, I'm happy to discuss them. Please let me know if you need any additional information or access to assist with this request.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
