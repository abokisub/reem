CRITICAL: Server is on WRONG commit!

Current commit: abb97b1 (BEFORE webhook fix)
Required commit: 169de98 (latest with webhook fix)

The webhook signature validation is failing for Kobopoint because you rolled back
to a commit BEFORE the fix for serialized webhook secrets.

RUN THIS IMMEDIATELY:
===================

cd ~/app.pointwave.ng
git reset --hard 169de98
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Clear OPcache
curl https://app.pointwave.ng/clear-opcache.php

# Verify it's working
curl -I https://app.pointwave.ng/api/health

EXPLANATION:
============
Commit b769562 fixed the webhook signature bug where webhook_secret was being
stored as a serialized PHP string in the database. The fix properly handles
both serialized and plain webhook secrets.

When you rolled back to abb97b1, you removed this fix, causing ALL webhook
signature validations to fail (both Kobopoint and Amtpay).

The latest commit (169de98) includes:
- The webhook signature fix (b769562)
- All testing scripts
- All other fixes

You MUST be on commit 169de98 or later for webhooks to work properly.
