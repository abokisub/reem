Hi PointWave Team,

WEBHOOK SIGNATURE ISSUE - FIXED ✅

The Problem:
- We were computing signature on one JSON string
- But sending a different JSON string
- Kobopoint computed different signature → HTTP 401 errors

The Fix (Already Pushed):
- Modified app/Jobs/SendOutgoingWebhook.php
- Now we sign the EXACT JSON we send
- Removed "sha256=" prefix
- Used consistent JSON encoding

Deploy Now:
1. cd /path/to/app.pointwave.ng
2. bash DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_FIX.sh
3. php retry_failed_company_webhooks.php

Expected Result:
✅ All webhooks will succeed with HTTP 200
✅ Kobopoint customers will see balance updates
✅ No more "Invalid signature" errors
