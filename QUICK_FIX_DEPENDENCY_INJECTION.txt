========================================
QUICK FIX: Dependency Injection Error
========================================

ERROR:
------
Too few arguments to function App\Services\PalmPay\TransferService::__construct(), 
0 passed in BankingService.php on line 67 and exactly 3 expected

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
BankingService was manually instantiating TransferService with:
  new \App\Services\PalmPay\TransferService()

But TransferService requires 3 dependencies:
  - LedgerService
  - FeeService  
  - FinancialStateService

FIX:
----
Changed from manual instantiation to Laravel's service container:
  app(\App\Services\PalmPay\TransferService::class)

This automatically resolves and injects all required dependencies.

DEPLOY:
-------
cd /home/aboksdfs/app.pointwave.ng
git pull origin main

That's it! No migration, no cache clear needed.

WHAT THIS FIXES:
----------------
✅ Transfer functionality will work properly
✅ All dependencies automatically injected
✅ No more constructor argument errors

FILE CHANGED:
-------------
- app/Services/Banking/BankingService.php
